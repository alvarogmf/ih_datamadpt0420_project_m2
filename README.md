## Overview
This is the first project of two. In this one, I have done an analysis on the diamonds data, understanding the different kinds of diamonds, according to their color, their carats, their cut...

There are two different analysis in this proyect:

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Exploratory analysis with insights regarding price depending on different characteristics of diamonds. The file can be found in this GitHub with the name: data_analysis_report
- **Tableau Dashboard:** Analysis made on Tableau, with three different sections:
  - Identifying the data: here we try to understand what information we are dealing with in the dataset
  - Price - Characteristics Relationships: to understand the relationship between the prices of the diamonds and their different characteristics,
  - Characteristics Deep Dive: the last section is used to understand the relationship of the characteristics between them regarding the price.

This **Tableau Dashboard** can be found in the following [link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alvaro5559#!/vizhome/ih_datamadpt1120_project_m2_16142733820460/DiamondsAnalysis?publish=yes).
